Description: Functions for finding the implied Black-Scholes (lognormal) and 
    Bachelier (normal) volatilities of a financial option. This package uses the
    techniques described by Peter J채ckel and his reference C++ implementations,
    which are fast and highly accurate. This package additionally includes
    forward functions that compute option prices from the volatilities.
